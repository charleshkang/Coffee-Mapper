# Coffee Mapper
A <strong>WIP</strong> social platform for coffee lovers

# The Idea
I wanted to make an app similar to <a href="https://untappd.com">Untappd</a>, but specifically for coffee! I want users to be able to post pictures of the coffee they're drinking, where they're drinking at, and make the social aspect of coffee even more awesome.
